# Human-Following-Robot-Using-Deep-Learning-Object-Detection-for-Assistive-Load-Transportation
Developed a low-cost Raspberry Pi 5 robot that tracks a red circular marker for indoor load carrying in healthcare/logistics. Trained YOLOv8n on 4,500 images, optimized with NCNN for 8-9 FPS real-time detection. Implemented vision-based steering/distance control and IR obstacle avoidance for robust performance in crowds
